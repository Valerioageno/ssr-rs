# SSR-RS examples

This folder includes examples to ease the usage of the library.

The most complete react example is `webpack-react` since it includes the 
server side props handling, the react hydration and the assets generation.

`vite-react` and `rspack-react` just showcase a base bundler configuration. For the above
features the porting is pretty straightforward.

The other example at the folder root show a simple configuration with the most common rust backend frameworks.

> Any example improvement or suggestion will be appreciated.
